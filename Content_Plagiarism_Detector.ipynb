      "notifications in python decorators are a powerful and flexible way to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without changing their actual code. a decorator is essentially a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function with enhanced functionality. decorators are often used in scenarios such as logging authentication and memorization allowing us to add additional functionality to existing functions or methods in a clean reusable way. explanation lets explore decorators in detail table of content def decorator_namefunc def wrapperargs kwargs  add functionality before the original function call result  funcargs kwargs  add functionality after the original function call return result return wrapper decorator_namedef function_to_decorate  original function code pass 1. decorator_namefunc 2. wrapperargs kwargs 3. decorator_name in python higherorder functions are functions that take one or more functions as arguments return a function as a result or do both. essentially a higherorder function is a function that operates on other functions. this is a powerful concept in functional programming and is a key component in understanding how decorators work. example of a higherorder function in this example first function fun is a higherorder function because it takes another function f as an argument and applies it to the value x. decorators in python are a type of higherorder function because they take a function as input modify it and return a new function that extends or changes its behavior. understanding higherorder functions is essential for working with decorators since decorators are essentially functions that return other functions. in python functions are firstclass objects meaning that they can be treated like any other object such as integers strings or lists. this gives functions a unique level of flexibility and allows them to be passed around and manipulated in ways that are not possible in many other programming languages. explanation the most common type of decorator which takes a function as input and returns a new function. the example above demonstrates this type. explanation used to decorate methods within a class. they often handle special cases such as the self argument for instance methods. explanation class decorators are used to modify or enhance the behavior of a class. like function decorators class decorators are applied to the class definition. they work by taking the class as an argument and returning a modified version of the class. example explanation python provides several builtin decorators that are commonly used in class definitions. these decorators modify the behavior of methods and attributes in a class making it easier to manage and use them effectively. the most frequently used builtin decorators are staticmethod classmethod and property. the staticmethod decorator is used to define a method that doesnt operate on an instance of the class i.e. it doesnt use self. static methods are called on the class itself not on an instance of the class. example explanation the classmethod decorator is used to define a method that operates on the class itself i.e. it uses cls. class methods can access and modify class state that applies across all instances of the class. example explanation the property decorator is used to define a method as a property which allows you to access it like an attribute. this is useful for encapsulating the implementation of a method while still providing a simple interface. example explanation in simpler terms chaining decorators means decorating a function with multiple decorators. example decorators are used to modify the behavior of functions or methods. use them when you want to add functionality like logging cachingor authentication to existing functions without modifying their source code. they help in separating concerns and improving code readability.  function a function in python is a block of code that performs a specific task accepts inputs arguments processes them and optionally returns an output.  decorator a decorator is a higherorder function that takes another function as an argument adds some functionality and returns a new function. it allows modifying or extending behavior of functions or methods. __init__ is a special method constructor in python classes. its automatically called when a new instance of a class is created. it initializes the objects attributes or performs any setup needed for the object. in python a decorator is a function that modifies another function or method. annotations are a way to attach metadata to function arguments and return values using the  and  syntax. they dont change the function behavior. level up your coding with dsa python in 90 days! master key algorithms solve complex problems and prepare for top tech interviews. join the three 90 challengecomplete 90 of the course in 90 days and earn a 90 refund. start your python dsa journey today! s \n",

python decorators are and how to create and use them. in order to understand decorators you must first understand some finer points of how functions work. there are many aspects to functions but in the context of decorators a function returns a value based on the given arguments. heres a basic example in general functions in python may also have side effects rather than just turning an input into an output. the print function is an example of this it returns none while having the side effect of outputting something to the console. however to understand decorators its enough to think about functions as tools that turn given arguments into values. in functional programming you work almost entirely with pure functions that dont have side effects. while not a purely functional language python supports many functional programming concepts including treating functions as firstclass objects. this means that functions can be passed around and used as arguments just like any other object like str int float list and so on. consider the following three functions here say_hello and be_awesome are regular functions that expect a name given as a string. the greet_bob function however expects a function as its argument. you can for example pass it the say_hello or the be_awesome function. to test your functions you can run your code in interactive mode. you do this with the i flag. for example if your code is in a file named greeters.py then you run python i greeters.py note that greet_bobsay_hello refers to two functions greet_bob and say_hello but in different ways. the say_hello function is named without parentheses. this means that only a reference to the function is passed. the function isnt executed. the greet_bob function on the other hand is written with parentheses so it will be called as usual. this is an important distinction thats crucial for how functions work as firstclass objects. a function name without parentheses is a reference to a function while a function name with trailing parentheses calls the function and refers to its return value. its possible to define functions inside other functions. such functions are called inner functions. heres an example of a function with two inner functions what happens when you call the parent function? think about this for a minute. then run inner_functions.py in interactive mode to try it out. the output will be as follows note that the order in which the inner functions are defined does not matter. like with any other functions the printing only happens when the inner functions are executed. furthermore the inner functions arent defined until the parent function is called. theyre locally scoped to parent meaning they only exist inside the parent function as local variables. try calling first_child. youll get an error whenever you call parent the inner functions first_child and second_child are also called. but because of their local scope they arent available outside of the parent function. python also allows you to return functions from functions. in the following example you rewrite parent to return one of the inner functions note that youre returning first_child without the parentheses. recall that this means that youre returning a reference to the function first_child. in contrast first_child with parentheses refers to the result of evaluating the function. you can see this in the following example the somewhat cryptic output means that the first variable refers to the local first_child function inside of parent while second points to second_child. you can now use first and second as if theyre regular functions even though you cant directly access the functions they point to you recognize the return values of the inner functions that you defined inside of parent. finally note that in the earlier example you executed the inner functions within the parent functionfor example first_child. however in this last example you didnt add parentheses to the inner functions such as first_child upon returning. that way you got a reference to each function that you could call in the future. now that youve seen that functions are just like any other object in python youre ready to move on and see the magical beast that is the python decorator. youll start with an example here youve defined two regular functions decorator and say_whee and one inner wrapper function. then you redefined say_whee to apply decorator to the original say_whee. can you guess what happens when you call say_whee? try it in a repl. instead of running the file with the i flag you can also import the function manually to understand whats going on here look back at the earlier examples. youre applying everything that youve learned so far. the socalled decoration happens at the following line in effect the name say_whee now points to the wrapper inner function. remember that you return wrapper as a function when you call decoratorsay_whee however wrapper has a reference to the original say_whee as func and it calls that function between the two calls to print. put simply a decorator wraps a function modifying its behavior. before moving on have a look at a second example. because wrapper is a regular python function the way a decorator modifies a function can change dynamically. so as not to disturb your neighbors the following example will only run the decorated code during the day if you try to call say_whee after bedtime nothing will happen here say_whee doesnt print any output. thats because the if test failed so the wrapper didnt call func the original say_whee. look back at the code that you wrote in hello_decorator.py. the way you decorated say_whee is a little clunky. first of all you end up typing the name say_whee three times. additionally the decoration gets hidden away below the definition of the function. instead python allows you to use decorators in a simpler way with the  symbol sometimes called the pie syntax. the following example does the exact same thing as the first decorator example so decorator is just a shorter way of saying say_whee  decoratorsay_whee. its how you apply a decorator to a function. recall that a decorator is just a regular python function. all the usual tools for reusability are available. now youll create a module where you store your decorators and that you can use in many other functions. create a file called decorators.py with the following content the do_twice decorator calls the decorated function twice. youll soon see the effect of this in several examples. note you can name your inner function whatever you want and a generic name like wrapper is usually okay. youll see a lot of decorators in this tutorial. to keep them apart youll name the inner function with the same name as the decorator but with a wrapper_ prefix. you can now use this new decorator in other files by doing a regular import when you run this example you should see that the original say_whee is executed twice there are two whee! exclamations printed confirming that do_twice does what it says on the tin. free bonus click here to get access to a free the power of python decorators guide that shows you three advanced decorator patterns and techniques you can use to write cleaner and more pythonic programs. say that you have a function that accepts some arguments. can you still decorate it? give it a try you now apply do_twice to greet which expects a name. unfortunately calling this function raises an error the problem is that the inner function wrapper_do_twice doesnt take any arguments but you passed nameworld to it. you could fix this by letting wrapper_do_twice accept one argument but then it wouldnt work for the say_whee function that you created earlier. the solution is to use args and kwargs in the inner wrapper function. then itll accept an arbitrary number of positional and keyword arguments. rewrite decorators.py as follows the wrapper_do_twice inner function now accepts any number of arguments and passes them on to the function that it decorates. now both your say_whee and greet examples work. start a fresh repl you use the same decorator do_twice to decorate two different functions. this hints at one of the powers of decorators. they add behavior that can apply to many different functions. what happens to the return value of decorated functions? well thats up to the decorator to decide. say you decorate a simple function as follows try to use it oops your decorator ate the return value from the function. because the do_twice_wrapper doesnt explicitly return a value the call return_greetingadam ends up returning none. to fix this you need to make sure the wrapper function returns the return value of the decorated function. change your decorators.py file now you return the return value of the last call of the decorated function. check out the example again this time return_greeting returns the greeting hi adam. a great convenience when working with python especially in the interactive shell is its powerful introspection ability. introspection is the ability of an object to know about its own attributes at runtime. for instance a function knows its own name and documentation when you inspect print you can see its name and documentation. the introspection works for functions that you define yourself as well however after being decorated say_whee has gotten very confused about its identity. it now reports being the wrapper_do_twice inner function inside the do_twice decorator. although technically true this isnt very useful information. to fix this decorators should use the functools.wraps decorator which will preserve information about the original function. update decorators.py again you dont need to change anything about the decorated say_whee function but you need to restart your repl to see the effect much better! now say_whee is still itself after decoration. note the functools.wraps decorator uses functools.update_wrapper to update special attributes like __name__ and __doc__ that are used in the introspection. youve now learned the basics of how to create a decorator. however do_twice isnt a very exciting decorator and there arent a lot of use cases for it. in the next section youll implement several decorators that illustrate what you know so far and that you can use in your own code. youll now look at a few more useful examples of decorators. youll notice that theyll mainly follow the same pattern that youve learned so far this formula is a good boilerplate template for building more complex decorators. youll continue to store your decorators in decorators.py. recall that you can download all the examples in this tutorial get your code click here to download the free sample code that shows you how to create and use python decorators. youll start by creating a timer decorator. itll measure the time a function takes to execute and then print the duration to the console. heres the code this decorator works by storing the time just before the function starts running in line 10 and just after the function finishes in line 12. the runtime of the function is then the difference between the two calculated in line 13. you use time.perf_counter which does a good job of measuring time intervals. now add waste_some_time as an example of a function that spends some time so that you can test timer. here are some examples of timings run it yourself. work through the definition of timer line by line. make sure you understand how it works. dont worry if you dont get everything though. decorators are advanced beings. try to sleep on it or make a drawing of the program flow. note the timer decorator is great if you just want to get an idea about the runtime of your functions. if you want to do more precise measurements of code then you should instead consider the timeit module in the standard library. it temporarily disables garbage collection and runs multiple trials to strip out noise from short function calls. if youre interested in learning more about timing functions then have a look at python timer functions three ways to monitor your code. the following debug decorator will print a functions arguments and its return value every time you call the function the signature is created by joining the string representations of all the argument its time to see how the decorator works in practice by applying it to a simple function with one positional and one keyword argument note how the debug decorator prints the signature and return value of the make_greeting function this example might not seem immediately useful since the debug decorator just repeats what you wrote. its more powerful when applied to small convenience functions that you dont call directly yourself. the following example calculates an approximation of the mathematical constant e here you also apply a decorator to a function that has already been defined. in line 4 you decorate factorial from the math standard library. you cant use the pie syntax but you can still manually apply the decorator. the approximation of e is based on the following series expansion when calling the approximate_e function you can see the debug decorator at work in this example you get a decent approximation of the true value e  2.718281828 adding only five terms. in this section youll create a decorator that slows down your code. this might not seem very useful. why would you want to slow down your python code? probably the most common use case is that you want to ratelimit a function that continuously checks whether a resourcelike a web pagehas changed. the slow_down decorator will sleep one second before it calls the decorated function in slow_down you call time.sleep to have your code take a pause before calling the decorated function. to see how the slow_down decorator works you create a countdown function. to see the effect of slowing down the code you should run the example yourself in countdown you check if from_number is smaller than one. in that case you print liftoff!. if not then you print the number and keep counting. note the countdown function is a recursive function. in other words its a function calling itself. to learn more about recursive functions in python see thinking recursively in python. the slow_down decorator always sleeps for one second. later youll see how to control the rate by passing an argument to the decorator. decorators dont have to wrap the function that theyre decorating. they can also simply register that a function exists and return it unwrapped. you can use this for example to create a lightweight plugin architecture the register decorator only stores a reference to the decorated function in the global plugins dictionary. note that you dont have to write an inner function or use functools.wraps in this example because youre returning the original function unmodified. you can now register functions as follows note that the plugins dictionary already contains references to each function object thats registered as a plugin python applies decorators when you define a function so say_hello and be_awesome are immediately registered. you can then use plugins to call these functions the randomly_greet function randomly chooses one of the registered functions to use. in the fstring you use the !r flag. this has the same effect as calling reprgreeter. the main benefit of this simple plugin architecture is that you dont need to maintain a list of which plugins exist. that list is created when the plugins register themselves. this makes it trivial to add a new plugin just define the function and decorate it with register. if youre familiar with globals in python then you might see some similarities to how the plugin architecture works. with globals you get access to all global variables in the current scope including your plugins using the register decorator you can create your own curated list of interesting names effectively handpicking some functions from globals. the final example before moving on to some fancier decorators is commonly used when working with a web framework. in this example youll use flask to set up a secret web page that should only be visible to users that are logged in or otherwise authenticated while this gives an idea about how to add authentication to your web framework you should usually not write these types of decorators yourself. for flask you can use the flasklogin extension instead which adds more security and functionality. so far youve seen how to create simple decorators. you already have a pretty good understanding of what decorators are and how they work. feel free to take a break from this tutorial to practice everything that youve learned. in the second part of this tutorial youll explore more advanced features including how to do the following ready to dive in? here you go! there are two different ways that you can use decorators on classes. the first one is very close to what youve already done with functions you can decorate the methods of a class. this was one of the motivations for introducing decorators back in the day. some commonly used decorators are even builtins in python including classmethod staticmethod and property. the classmethod and staticmethod decorators are used to define methods inside a class namespace that arent connected to a particular instance of that class. the property decorator is used to customize getters and setters for class attributes. expand the box below for an example using these decorators example using builtin class decoratorsshowhide the following definition of a circle class uses the classmethod staticmethod and property decorators inside circle you can see several different kinds of methods. decorators are used to distinguish them you can use circle as follows in these examples you explore the different methods attributes and properties of circle. next define a class where you decorate some of its methods using the debug and timer decorators from earlier using this class you can see the effect of the decorators when you create a new instance of timewaster python calls .__init__ under the hood as your use of debug reveals. the timer decorator helps you monitor how much time is spent on .waste_time. the other way to use decorators on classes is to decorate the whole class. this is for example done in the dataclasses module the meaning of the syntax is similar to the function decorators. in the example above you couldve decorated the class by writing playingcard  dataclassplayingcard. a common use of class decorators is to be a simpler alternative to some use cases of metaclasses. in both cases youre changing the definition of a class dynamically. writing a class decorator is very similar to writing a function decorator. the only difference is that the decorator will receive a class and not a function as an argument. in fact all the decorators that you saw above will work as class decorators. when youre using them on a class instead of a function their effect might not be what you want. in the following example the timer decorator is applied to a class decorating a class doesnt decorate its methods. recall that timer is just shorthand for timewaster  timertimewaster. here timer only measures the time that it takes to instantiate the class the output from timer is only shown as tw is created. the call to .waste_time isnt timed. later youll see an example defining a proper class decorator namely singleton which ensures that theres only one instance of a class. you can apply several decorators to a function at once by stacking them on top of each other think about this as the decorators being executed in the order theyre listed. in other words debug calls do_twice which calls greet or debugdo_twicegreet the greeting is printed twice because of do_twice. however the output from debug is only shown once since its called before the do_twice decorator. observe the difference if you change the order of debug and do_twice here do_twice is applied to debug as well. you can see that both calls to greet are annotated with debugging information. sometimes its useful to pass arguments to your decorators. for instance do_twice could be extended to a repeatnum_times decorator. the number of times to execute the decorated function could then be given as an argument. if you define repeat you could do something like this think about how youd implement repeat. so far the name written after the  has referred to a function object that can be called with another function. to be consistent you then need repeatnum_times4 to return a function object that can act as a decorator. luckily you already know how to return functions! in general you want something like the following typically the decorator creates and returns an inner wrapper function so writing the example out in full will give you an inner function within an inner function. while this might sound like the programming equivalent of the inception youll untangle it all in a moment it looks a little messy but youve only put the same decorator pattern that youve seen many times by now inside one additional def that handles the arguments to the decorator. first consider the innermost function this wrapper_repeat function takes arbitrary arguments and returns the value of the decorated function func. this wrapper function also contains the loop that calls the decorated function num_times times. this is no different from the earlier wrapper functions that youve seen except that its using the num_times parameter that must be supplied from the outside. one step out youll find the decorator function again decorator_repeat looks exactly like the decorator functions that youve written earlier except that its named differently. thats because you reserve the base namerepeatfor the outermost function which is the one the user will call. as youve already seen the outermost function returns a reference to the decorator function there are a few subtle things happening in the repeat function with everything set up test your code to see if the results are as expected thats just the result that you were aiming for. with a little bit of care you can also define decorators that can be used both with and without arguments. most likely you dont need this but it is nice to have the flexibility. like winniethepooh says bothbut dont bother about the bread please. source as you saw in the previous section when a decorator uses arguments you need to add an extra outer function. the challenge now is for your code to figure out if youve called the decorator with or without arguments. since the function to decorate is only passed in directly if the decorator is called without arguments the function must be an optional argument. this means that the decorator arguments must all be specified by keyword. you can enforce this with the special asterisk  syntax which means that all the following parameters are keywordonly here the _func argument acts as a marker noting whether the decorator has been called with arguments or not using this boilerplate on the repeat decorator in the previous section you can write the following compare this with the original repeat. the only changes are the added _func parameter and the ifelse block at the end. recipe 9.6 of the excellent python cookbook shows an alternative solution using functools.partial. you can now apply repeat to different functions to test that you can now use it with or without arguments recall that the default value of num_times is 2 so using repeat without any arguments is equivalent to using do_twice here whee! is repeated twice since thats the default behavior of repeat. as specified by the argument the greeting is repeated three times. sometimes its useful to have a decorator that can keep track of state. as an example youll create a decorator that counts the number of times a function is called. note in the beginning of this guide you learned about pure functions returning a value based on given arguments. stateful decorators are quite the opposite where the return value will depend on the current state as well as the given arguments. in the next section youll see how to use classes to keep state. but in simple cases you can also get away with using function attributes the statethe number of calls to the functionis stored in the function attribute .num_calls on the wrapper function. heres the effect of using it you apply count_calls to your old friend say_whee. each time you call the function you see that the call count increases. you can also manually query the .num_calls attribute. the typical way to maintain state in python is by using classes. in this section youll see how to rewrite the count_calls example from the previous section to use a class as a decorator. recall that the decorator syntax decorator is just a quicker way of saying func  decoratorfunc. therefore if decorator is a class it needs to take func as an argument in its .__init__ initializer. furthermore the class instance needs to be callable so that it can stand in for the decorated function. note up until now all the decorators that youve seen have been defined as functions. this is how you most often will create decorators. however you can use any callable expression as a decorator. for a class instance to be callable you implement the special .__call__ method the .__call__ method is executed each time you try to call an instance of the class each time you call counter the state changes as the count increases. therefore a typical implementation of a decorator class should implement .__init__ and .__call__ the .__init__ method must store a reference to the function and it can do any other necessary initialization. the .__call__ method will be called instead of the decorated function. it does essentially the same thing as the wrapper function in your earlier examples. note that you need to use the functools.update_wrapper function instead of functools.wraps. this countcalls decorator works the same as the one in the previous section each call to say_whee is counted and noted. in the next section youll look at more examples of decorators. youve come a long way now having figured out how to create all kinds of decorators. youll wrap it up putting your newfound knowledge to use by creating a few more examples that might be useful in the real world. as noted earlier your previous implementation of slow_down always sleeps for one second. now you know how to add parameters to decorators so you can rewrite slow_down using an optional rate argument that controls how long it sleeps youre using the boilerplate introduced in the creating decorators with optional arguments section to make slow_down callable both with and without arguments. the same recursive countdown function as earlier now sleeps two seconds between each count as before you must run the example yourself to see the effect of the decorator therell be a two second pause between each number in the countdown. a singleton is a class with only one instance. there are several singletons in python that you use frequently including none true and false. the fact that none is a singleton allows you to compare for none using the is keyword like you did when creating decorators with optional arguments using is returns true only for objects that are the exact same instance. the following singleton decorator turns a class into a singleton by storing the first instance of the class as an attribute. later attempts at creating an instance simply return the stored instance as you see this class decorator follows the same template as your function decorators. the only difference is that youre using cls instead of func as the parameter name to indicate that its meant to be a class decorator. check it out in practice by comparing object ids and checking with the is keyword you confirm that first_one is indeed the exact same instance as another_one. note singleton classes arent really used as often in python as in other languages. the effect of a singleton is usually better implemented as a global variable inside a module. class decorators are less common than function decorators. you should document these well so that your users know how to apply them. decorators can provide a nice mechanism for caching and memoization. as an example look at a recursive definition of the fibonacci sequence while this implementation is straightforward its runtime performance is terrible to calculate the tenth fibonacci number you should only need to calculate the preceding fibonacci numbers but this implementation somehow needs a whopping 177 calculations. it gets worse quickly 21891 calculations are needed for fibonacci20 and almost 2.7 million calculations for the thirtieth number. this is because the code keeps recalculating fibonacci numbers that are already known. the usual solution is to implement fibonacci numbers using a for loop and a lookup table. however caching the calculations will also do the trick. first add a cache decorator to your module the cache works as a lookup table as it stores calculations in a dictionary. you can add it to fibonacci you still use count_calls to monitor the performance of your calculations. with the cache fibonacci only does the necessary calculations once note that in the call to fibonacci8 no new calculations were needed since the eighth fibonacci number had already been calculated for fibonacci10. in the standard library a least recently used lru cache is available as functools.lru_cache. additionally you can use a regular cache with functools.cache. these decorators have more features than the one you saw above. you should use functools.lru_cache or functools.cache instead of writing your own cache decorator. in the next example you dont return the result immediately. instead you add a call to print to see when a result is calculated and not just retrieved from the cache the maxsize parameter specifies how many recent calls are cached. the default value is 128 but you can specify maxsizenone to cache all function calls. using functools.cache has the same effect as maxsizenone. however be aware that this can cause memory problems if youre caching many large objects. you can use the .cache_info method to see how the cache performs and you can tune it if needed. in your example you used an artificially small maxsize to see the effect of elements being removed from the cache in these examples you calculate a few fibonacci numbers. your cache only holds four calculations at a time. for example after calculating fibonacci10 it holds the seventh eight ninth and tenth number. therefore youre able to find fibonacci8 without doing any recalculations. then you ask for fibonacci5 but that fifth number has been deleted from the cache. it therefore needs to be calculated from scratch. in most applications you dont need to constrain your cache and can use functools.cache directly. the following example is somewhat similar to the registering plugins example from earlier in that it doesnt really change the behavior of the decorated function. instead it simply adds unit as a function attribute the following example calculates the volume of a cylinder based on its radius and height in centimeters youve added information to volume that the result should be interpreted as cubic centimeters. you can later access the .unit function attribute when needed note that you couldve achieved something similar using function annotations however since annotations are used for type hints its a bit clunky to combine such units as annotations with static type checking. units become even more powerful and fun when connected with a library that can convert between units. one such library is pint. with pint installed python m pip install pint you can convert the volume to cubic inches or gallons for example you use pint to create a quantity that has both a magnitude and a unit. by calling .to you convert to other units. for example the example cylinder is about 141 cubic centimeters which translates to approximately 8.63 cubic inches and 0.0373 gallons. you could also modify the decorator to return a pint quantity directly. such a quantity is made by multiplying a value with the unit. in pint units must be looked up in a unitregistry. you can store the registry as a function attribute on the decorator to avoid cluttering the namespace with the use_unit decorator converting units is practically effortless when usain bolt ran 100 meters in 9.58 seconds at the 2009 world championships he had an average speed of 10.4 meters per second. this translates to about 37.6 kilometers per hour and 23.4 miles per hour. youll now look at one last use case. take a quick look at the following flask route handler here you ensure that the key student_id is part of the request. although this validation works it doesnt really belong in the function itself. additionally there may be other routes that use the same validation. so to keep it dry you can abstract out any unnecessary logic with a decorator. the following validate_json decorator will do the job in the above code the decorator takes a variablelength list as an argument so that you can pass in as many string arguments as necessary each representing a key used to validate the json data the route handler can then focus on its real jobupdating gradesas it can safely assume that the json data are valid you apply validate_json which simplifies the logic inside update_grade. this has been quite a journey! you started this tutorial by looking closer at functions and particularly how you can define them inside other functions and pass them around just like any other python object. then you learned about decorators and how to write them such that in the second part of the tutorial you saw more advanced decorators and learned how to you saw that to define a decorator you typically define a function returning a wrapper function. the wrapper function uses args and kwargs to pass on arguments to the decorated function. if you want your decorator to also take arguments then you need to nest the wrapper function inside another function. in this case you usually end up with three return statements. you can download the code from this tutorial by clicking below get your code click here to

toggle beside each question to reveal the answer. what are python decorators and how do they work?showhide python decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions or classes. you use them to wrap another function allowing you to add functionality to existing code without modifying it directly. what are some practical use cases for decorators in python?showhide you can use decorators to log function calls measure execution time enforce access control and authentication or cache results. theyre a powerful way to separate concerns and enhance code reusability. how do you write custom decorators in python?showhide to write a custom decorator you define a function that takes a function as an argument defines a wrapper function inside it and returns this wrapper. the wrapper function usually calls the original function and can modify its behavior. how do you apply multiple decorators to a single function in python?showhide you can apply multiple decorators to a function by stacking them above the function definition. the decorators will be applied from the bottom up meaning the topmost decorator will wrap all the others. does order of decorators matter in python?showhide yes the order of decorators matters. decorators are applied from the innermost to the outermost so the behavior of a function can change depending on how you order them. take the quiz

      " python decorators provide an easy yet powerful syntax for modifying and extending the behavior of functions in your code. a decorator is essentially a function that takes another function augments its functionality and returns a new function  without permanently modifying the original function itself. this tutorial will walk you through 11 handy decorators to help add functionality like timing execution caching rate limiting debugging and more. whether you want to profile performance improve efficiency validate data or manage errors these decorators have got you covered! the examples here focus on the common usage patterns and utilities of decorators that can come in handy in your daytoday programming and save you a lot of effort. understanding the flexibility of decorators will help you write clean resilient and optimized application code. here are the decorators covered in this tutorial log arguments and return value of a function get the execution time of a function convert function return value to a specified data type cache function results validate function arguments based on condition retry a function multiple times on failure enforce rate limits on a function handle exceptions and provide default response enforce type checking on function arguments measure memory usage of a function cache function results with expiration time conclusion but first a little introduction. before diving in lets understand some key benefits of decorators in python enhancing functions without invasive changes decorators augment functions transparently without altering the original code keeping the core logic clean and maintainable. reusing functionality across places common capabilities like logging caching and rate limiting can be built once in decorators and applied wherever needed. readable and declarative syntax the decorator syntax simply conveys functionality enhancement at the definition site. modularity and separation of concerns decorators promote loose coupling between functional logic and secondary capabilities like performance security logging etc. the takeaway is that decorators unlock simple yet flexible ways of transparently enhancing python functions for improved code organization efficiency and reuse without introducing complexity or redundancy. here is a basic example of decorator syntax in python with annotations a decorator in python is a function that takes another function as an argument and extends its behavior without modifying it. the decorator function wraps the original function by defining a wrapper function inside of it. this wrapper function executes code before and after calling the original function. specifically when defining a decorator function such as my_decorator in the example it takes a function as an argument which we generally call func. this func will be the actual function that is decorated under the hood. the wrapper function inside my_decorator can execute arbitrary code before and after calling func which invokes the original function. when applying my_decorator before the definition of my_function it passes my_function as an argument to my_decorator so func refers to my_function in that context. the wrapper function then returns the enhanced wrapped function. so now my_function has been decorated by my_decorator. when it is later called the wrapper code inside my_decorator executes before and after my_function runs. this allows decorators to transparently extend the behavior of a function without needing to modify the function itself. and as youll recall the original my_function remains unchanged keeping decorators noninvasive and flexible. when my_function is decorated with my_decorator it is automatically enhanced. the my_decorator function here returns a wrapper function. this wrapper function gets executed when the my_function is called now. first the wrapper prints before the function call before actually calling the original my_function function being decorated. then after my_function executes it prints after function call. so additional behavior and printed messages are added before and after the my_function execution in the wrapper without directly modifying my_function itself. the decorator allows you to extend my_function in a transparent way without affecting its core logic as the wrapper handles the enhanced behavior. applying a decorator to a function so lets start exploring the top 11 practical decorators that every python developer should know. the log arguments and return value decorator tracks the input parameters and output of functions. this supports debugging by logging a clear record of data flow through complex operations. output in this example the decorator function is named log_decorator and accepts a function original_function as its argument. within log_decorator a nested function called wrapper is defined. this wrapper function is what the decorator returns and effectively replaces the original function. when the wrapper function is invoked it prints logging statements pertaining to the function call. then it calls the original function original_function captures its result prints the outcome and returns the result. the log_decorator syntax above the calculate_product function is a python convention to apply the log_decorator as a decorator to the calculate_product function. so when calculate_product is invoked its actually invoking the wrapper function returned by log_decorator. therefore log_decorator acts as a wrapper introducing logging statements before and after the execution of the original calculate_product function. this decorator is widely adopted in application development for adding runtime logging without interfering with business logic implementation. for example consider a banking application that processes financial transactions. the core transaction processing logic resides in functions like transfer_funds and accept_payment. to monitor these transactions logging can be added by including log_decorator above each function. then when transactions are triggered by calling transfer_funds you can print the function name arguments like the sender receiver and amount before the actual transfer. then after the function returns you can print the whether the transfer succeeded or failed. this type of logging with decorators allows you to track transactions without adding any code to core functions like transfer_funds. the logic stays clean while debuggability and observability improves. logging messages can be directed to a monitoring dashboard or log analytics system as well. this decorator is your ally in the quest for performance optimization. by measuring and logging the execution time of a function this decorator facilitates a deep dive into the efficiency of your code helping you pinpoint bottlenecks and streamline your applications performance. its ideal for scenarios where speed is crucial such as realtime applications or largescale data processing. and it allows you to identify and address performance bottlenecks systematically. output this code showcases a decorator thats designed to measure the execution duration of functions. the measure_execution_time decorator takes a function func and defines an inner function timed_execution to wrap the original function. upon invocation timed_execution records the start time calls the original function records the end time calculates the duration and prints it. the measure_execution_time syntax applies this decorator to functions below it such as multiply_numbers. consequently when multiply_numbers is called it invokes the timed_execution wrapper which logs the duration alongside the function result. this example illustrates how decorators seamlessly augment existing functions with additional functionality like timing without direct modification. this decorator is helpful in profiling functions to identify performance bottlenecks in applications. for example consider an ecommerce site with several backend functions like get_recommendations calculate_shipping and so on. by decorating them with measure_execution_time you can monitor their runtime. when get_recommendations is invoked in a user session the decorator will time its execution duration by recording a start and end timestamp. after execution it will print the time taken before returning recommendations. doing this systematically across applications and analyzing outputs will show you the functions that are taking an unusually long time. the development team can then optimize such functions through caching parallel processing and other techniques to improve overall application performance. without such timing decorators finding optimization candidates would require tedious logging code additions. decorators provide visibility easily without contaminating business logic. the convert return value type decorator enhances data consistency in functions by automatically converting the return value to a specified data type promoting predictability and preventing unexpected errors. it is particularly useful for downstream processes that require consistent data types reducing runtime errors. output the above code example shows a decorator thats designed to convert the return value of a function to a specified data type. the decorator named convert_to_data_type takes the target data type as a parameter and returns a decorator named type_converter_decorator. within this decorator a wrapper function is defined to call the original function convert its return value to the target type using target_type and subsequently return the converted result. the syntax convert_to_data_typeint thats applied above a function such as add_values utilizes this decorator to convert the return value to an integer. similarly for concatenate_strings passing str formats the return value as a string. this example also showcases how decorators seamlessly modify function outputs to desired formats without altering the core logic of the functions. this return value transformation decorator proves useful in applications where you need to automatically adapt functions to expected data formats. for instance you could use it in a weather api that returns temperatures by default in decimal format like 23.456 degrees. but the consumer frontend application expects an integer value to display. instead of changing the api function to return an integer just decorate it with convert_to_data_typeint. this will seamlessly convert the decimal temperature to the integer 23 in this example before returning to the client app. without any api function modification youve reformatted the return value. similarly for backend processing expecting json return values can be converted using the convert_to_data_typejson decorator. the core logic stays unchanged while the presentation format adapts based on your use cases needs. this avoids duplication of format handling code across functions. decorators externally impose required data representations for seamless integration and reusability across application layers with mismatched formats. this decorator optimizes performance by storing and retrieving function results eliminating redundant computations for repeated inputs and improving application responsiveness especially for timeconsuming computations. output this code sample showcases a decorator thats designed to cache and reuse function call results efficiently. the cached_result_decorator function takes another function and returns a wrapper. within this wrapper a cache dictionary result_cache stores unique call parameters and their corresponding results. before executing the actual function the wrapper checks if the result for the current parameters is already in the cache. if so it retrieves and returns the cached result  otherwise it calls the function stores the result in the cache and returns it. the cached_result_decorator syntax applies this caching logic to any function such as multiply_numbers. this ensures that upon subsequent calls with the same arguments the cached result is reused preventing redundant calculations. in essence the decorator enhances functionality by optimizing performance through result caching. caching decorators like this are extremely useful in application development for optimizing performance of repetitive function calls. for example consider a recommendation engine calling predictive model functions to generate user suggestions. get_user_recommendations prepares the input data and feeds into the model for every user request.instead of rerunning computations it can be decorated with cached_result_decorator to introduce caching layer. now the first time unique user parameters are passed the model runs and the result caches. subsequent calls with the same inputs directly return the cached model outputs skipping the model recalculation. this drastically improves latency for responding to user requests by avoiding duplicate model inferences. you can monitor cache hit rates to justify scaling down model server infrastructure costs. decoupling such optimization concerns through caching decorators rather than mixing them inside function logic improves modularity readability and allows rapid performance gains. caches will be configured invalidated separately without intruding business functions. this one checks if input arguments meet predefined criteria before execution enhancing function reliability and preventing unexpected behavior. it is useful for parameters requiring positive integers or nonempty strings. output this code showcases how you can implement a decorator for validating function arguments. the check_condition_positive is a decorator factory that generates an argument_validator decorator. this validator when applied with check_condition_positive above the compute_cubed_result function checks if the condition in this case that the argument should be greater than 0 holds true for the passed arguments. if the condition is met the decorated function is executed  otherwise a valueerror exception is raised. this succinct example illustrates how decorators serve as a mechanism for validating function arguments before their execution ensuring adherence to specified conditions. such parameter validation decorators are extremely useful in applications to help enforce business rules security constraints and so on. for example an insurance claims processing system would have a function process_claim that takes details like claim id approver name and so on. certain business rules dictate who can approve claims. rather than cluttering the function logic itself you can decorate it with check_condition_positive which validates if the approver role matches the claim amount. if a junior agent tries approving a large claim thus violating the rules this decorator would catch it by raising exception even before process_claim executes. similarly input data validation constraints for security and compliance can be imposed without touching individual functions. decorators externally ensure that violated arguments never reach application risks. common validation patterns should be reused across multiple functions. this improves security and promotes separation of concerns by isolating constraints from core logic flow in a modular way. this decorator comes handy when you want to automatically retry a function after failure enhancing its resilience in situations involving transient failures. it is used for external services or network requests prone to intermittent failures. output this example introduces a decorator thats designed for retrying function executions in the event of failures. it has a specified maximum attempt count and delay between retries. the retry_on_failure is a decorator factory taking parameters for maximum retry count and delay and returning a decorator that manages the retry logic. within the wrapper function the decorated function undergoes execution in a loop attempting a specified maximum number of times. in case of an exception it prints an error message introduces a delay specified by retry_delay and retries. if all attempts fail it raises an exception indicating that the maximum attempts have been exceeded. the retry_on_failure applied above establish_database_connection integrates this retry logic allowing for up to 3 retries with a 2second delay between each attempt in case the database connection encounters failures. this demonstrates the utility of decorators in seamlessly incorporating retry capabilities without altering the core function code. this retry decorator can prove extremely useful in application development for adding resilience against temporary or intermittent errors. for instance consider a flight booking app that calls a payment gateway api process_payment to handle customer transactions. sometimes network blips or high loads at payment provider end could cause transient errors in api response. rather than directly showing failures to customers the process_payment function can be decorated with retry_on_failure to handle such scenarios implicitly. now when a payment fails once it will seamlessly retry sending the request up to 3 times before finally reporting the error if it persists. this provides shielding from temporary hiccups without exposing users to unreliable infrastructure behavior directly.the application also remains available reliably even if dependent services fail occasionally. the decorator helps confine the retry logic neatly without spreading it across the apis code. failures beyond the apps control are handled gracefully rather than directly impacting users by application faults. this demonstrates how decorators lend better resilience without complicating business logic. by controlling the frequency of functions called the enforce rate limits decorator ensures effective resource management and guards against misuse. it is especially helpful in scenarios like api misuse or resource conservation where restricting function calls is essential. output this code showcases the implementation of a ratelimiting mechanism for function calls using a decorator. the rate_limiter function specified with maximum calls and a period in seconds to reset the count serves as the core of the ratelimiting logic. the decorator decorate_rate_limited_function employs a wrapper to manage the rate limits by resetting the count if the period has elapsed. it checks if the count has reached the maximum allowed and then either raises an exception or increments the count and executes the function accordingly. applied to make_api_call using rate_limiter it restricts the function to six calls within any 10second period. this introduces rate limiting without changing the function logic ensuring that calls adhere to limits and preventing excessive use within set intervals. rate limiting decorators like this are very useful in application development for controlling usage of apis and preventing abuse. for instance a travel booking application may rely on third party flight search api for checking live seat availability across airlines. while most usage is legitimate some users could potentially call this api excessively degrading overall service performance. by decorating the api integration module like rate_limiter100 60 the application can restrict excessive calls internally too. this would limit the booking module to make only 100 flight api calls per minute. additional calls get rejected directly through the decorator without even reaching actual api. this saves downstream service from overuse enabling fairer distribution of capacity for general application functionality. decorators provide easy rate control for both internal and external facing apis without changing functional code. this means you dont have to account for usage quotas while safeguarding services infrastructure and bounding adoption risk. and its all thanks to applicationside controls using wrappers. the handle exceptions decorator is a safety net for functions gracefully handling exceptions and providing default responses when they occur. it shields the application from crashing due to unforeseen circumstances ensuring smooth operation. output this code showcases exception handling in functions using decorators. the handle_exceptions decorator factory accepting a default response produces exception_handler_decorator. this decorator when applied to functions attempts to execute the original function. if an exception arises it prints error details and returns the specified default response. the handle_exceptions syntax above a function incorporates this exceptionhandling logic. for instance in divide_numbers_safely division by zero triggers an exception which the decorator catches preventing a crash and returning the default an error occurred! response. essentially these decorators adeptly capture exceptions in functions providing a seamless means of incorporating handling logic and preventing crashes. exception handling decorators greatly simplify application error management and help hide unreliable behavior from users. for example an ecommerce website may rely on payment inventory and shipping services to complete orders. instead of complex exception blocks everywhere core order processing function like place_order can be decorated to achieve resilience. the handle_exceptions decorator applied above it would absorb any third party service outage or intermittent issue during order finalization. on exception it logs errors for debugging while serving a graceful order failed please try again later message to the customer. this avoids expose complex failure root causes like payment timeouts to end user. decorators shield customers from unreliable service issues without changing business code. they provide friendly default responses when errors happen. this improves customer experience also decorators give developers visibility into those errors behind the scenes. so they can focus on systematically fixing the root causes of failures. this separation of concerns through decorators reduces complexity. customers see more reliability and you get actionable insights into faults  all while keeping business logic untouched. the enforce type checking decorator ensures data integrity by verifying function arguments conform to specified data types preventing typerelated errors and promoting code reliability. it is particularly useful in situations where strict data type adherence is crucial. output the enforce_type_checking decorator validates whether the arguments passed to a function match the specified type annotations. inside the type_checked_wrapper it examines the signature of the decorated function retrieves parameter names and type annotations and ensures that the provided arguments align with the expected types. this includes checking positional arguments against their order and keyword arguments against parameter names. if a type mismatch is detected a typeerror is raised. this decorator is exemplified by its application to the multiply_numbers function where arguments are annotated as integers. attempting to pass a string results in an exception while passing integers executes the function without issues. this type checking is enforced without altering the original function body. type checking decorators are applied to detect issues early and improve reliability. for example consider a web application backend with a data access layer function get_user_data annotated to expect integer user ids. its queries would fail if string ids flow into it from frontend code. rather than add explicit checks and raise exceptions locally you can use this decorator. now any upstream or consumer code passing invalid types will be automatically caught during function execution. the decorator examines annotations versus argument types and throws errors accordingly before reaching the database layer. this runtime protection for components through decorators ensures that only valid data shapes flow across layers preventing obscure errors. type safety is imposed without extra checks cluttering cleaner logic. when it comes to large datasetintensive applications or resourceconstrained environments the measure memory usage decorator is a memory detective that offers insights into function memory consumption. it does this by optimising memory usage. output this code showcases a decorator measure_memory_usage designed to measure the memory consumption of functions. the decorator when applied initiates memory tracking before the original function is called. once the function completes its execution a memory snapshot is taken and the top 5 lines consuming the most memory are printed. illustrated through the example of calculate_factorial_recursive the decorator allows you to monitor memory usage without altering the function itself offering valuable insights for optimization purposes. in essence it provides a straightforward means to assess and analyze the memory consumption of any function during its runtime. memory measurement decorators like these are extremely valuable in application development for identifying and troubleshooting memory bloat or leak issues. for example consider a data streaming pipeline with critical etl components like transform_data that processes large volumes of information. though the process seems fine during regular loads high volume data like black friday sales could cause excessive memory usage and crashes. rather than manual debugging decorating processors like measure_memory_usage can reveal useful insights. it will print the top memory intensive lines during peak data flow without any code change. you should aim to pinpoint specific stages eating up memory rapidly and address through better algorithms or optimization. such decorators help bake diagnostics perspectives across critical paths to recognize abnormal consumption trends early. instead of delayed production issues problems can be preemptively identified through profiling before release. they reduce debugging headaches and minimize runtime failures via easier instrumentation for memory tracking. specifically designed for outdated data the cache function results with expiration time decorator is a tool that combines caching with a timebased expiration feature to make sure that cached data is regularly refreshed to prevent staleness and maintain relevance. output this code showcases a caching decorator that has an automatic cache expiration time. the function cached_function_with_expiry generates a decorator that when applied utilizes a dictionary called cache to store function results and their corresponding timestamps. the wrapper function checks if the result for the current arguments is in the cache. if present and within the expiry time it returns the cached result  otherwise it calls the function. illustrated using calculate_product the decorator initially calculates and caches the result. subsequent calls retrieve the cached result until the expiry period at which point the cache is refreshed through a recalculation. in essence this implementation prevents redundant calculations while automatically refreshing results after the specified expiry period. automatic cache expiry decorators are very useful in application development for optimizing performance of data fetching modules. for example consider a travel website that calls backend api get_flight_prices to show live prices to users. while caches reduce calls to expensive flight data sources static caching leads to displaying stale prices. instead you can use cached_function_with_expiry60 to autorefresh every minute. now the first user call fetches live prices and caches them while subsequent requests in a 60s window efficiently reuse the cached pricing. but caches automatically invalidate after the expiry period to guarantee fresh data. this allows your to optimize flows without worrying about corner cases related to outdated representations. this decorator handles the situation reliably keeping caches in sync with upstream changes through configurable refreshing. theres zero redundancy of recalculations and you still get the best possible updated information to end users. common caching patterns get packaged conveniently for reuse across codebase with customized expiry rules. python decorators continue to see widespread usage in application development for cleanly inserting common crosscutting concerns. authentications monitoring and restrictions are some standard examples of use cases that use decorators in frameworks like django and flask. the popularity of web apis has also lead to common adoption of rate limiting and caching decorators for performance. decorators have actually been around since early python releases. guido van rossum wrote about enhancement with decorators in a 1990 paper on python. later when function decorators syntax stabilized in python 2.4 in 2004 it opened the doors for elegant solutions through oriented programming. from web to data science they continue to empower abstraction and modularity across python domains. the examples in this handbook only scratch the surface of what custom tailored decorators can enable. based on any specific objective like security throttling user requests transparent encryption and so on you can create innovative decorators to address your needs. structuring logic processing pipelines using a composition of specialized singleresponsibility decorators also encourages reuse over redundancy. understanding decorators not only improves development skills but unlocks ways to dictate program behaviour flexibly. i encourage you to assess common needs across your codebases that can be abstracted into standalone decorators. with some practice it becomes easy to spot crosscutting concerns and extend functions efficiently without breaking a sweat. if you liked this lesson and would like to explore more insightful tech content including python django and system design reads check out my

      "notifications everything in python is an object. even function is a type of object in python. decorators are a special type of function which return a wrapper function. they are considered very powerful in python and are used to modify the behaviour of a function temporarily without changing its actual value. nesting means placing or storing inside the other. therefore nested decorators means applying more than one decorator inside a function. python allows us to implement more than one decorator to a function. it makes decorators useful for reusable building blocks as it accumulates the several effects together. a function can be decorated multiple times. we need to define the decorator first that we want to wrap the output string with and then apply them to the function using the  . one simply needs to place the decorators above the desired function. syntax  nested decorators follow a bottom to top approach i.e the reverse order. it can be related to a construction of building where we start the construction from the bottom the ground and then start building the floors. example  output explanation  level up your coding with dsa python in 90 days! master key algorithms solve complex problems and prepare for top tech interviews. join the three 90 challengecomplete 90 of the course in 90 days and earn a 90 refund. start your python dsa journey today! v \n",
      "decorator in python is an important feature used to add functionalities to an existing function object or code without modifying its structure permanently. it allows you to wrap a function to another function and extend its behavior. decorators in python are usually called before the definition of the tobe decorated function. before going any further about decorators it is essential to know more about functions. functions in python are firstclass objects that support various operations. the properties of functions and other firstclass objects can be since you now know a bit about functions and what decorators in python do itâs time to get acquainted with the syntax which is def func_name â â â â printsimplilearn function code func_name  name_decoratorfunc_name in the above syntax python also provides a simpler syntax to write decorators in python using symbol and the decoratorâs name. this simpler way of calling decorators is also called the syntactic way or the âpieâ syntax. with the simpler syntax the code is equal to  name_decorator def func_name â â â â printsimplilearn the only difference in using both the syntax is that if you want to assign the decorated function to another variable of a function use the extended syntax. on the other hand if youâre going to change the same functionâs variables and content you can use both the long and short syntax. letâs look at an example to better understand the concept of decorators in python. in the example below you will create a decorator to add the functionality of converting a string from another function to the uppercase. defining the decorator def name_decoratorfunction â â â â defining the wrapper function â â â â def inner_wrapper â â â â â â â â defining and calling the actual function â â â â â â â â func_name  function â â â â â â â â uppercase_func  func_name.upper â â â â â â â â print uppercase_func â â â â return inner_wrapper defining the function that will be called in decorator def greet â â â â return welcome to simplilearn â â â â print greet decorated  name_decoratorgreet decorated print greet in the example above name_decorator is the decorator. the function âgreetâ got decorated and was assigned to âdecorated.â as you can see when you print the decorated function it prints the string in uppercase. however when you call the greet function again it prints the exact string in the lowercase. thus the greet function is not changed permanently. in the example above you worked with a function that did not have any parameters. but what if the function has parameters? letâs have a look. def arguments_decoratorfunction â â â â def wrapper_argumentsar1 ar2 â â â â â â â â printarguments passed are 0 1.formatar1ar2 â â â â â â â â functionar1 ar2 â â â â return wrapper_arguments arguments_decorator def namefirst_name last_name â â â â printmy name is 0 1.formatfirst_name last_name namegeorge hotz since a decorator is also like a normal function you can easily reuse it like the others by moving it to the âdecoratorsâ module. in the code below you will create a file named âdecorators.py.â the file will contain a decorator function that will print an output multiple times. next you will import the decorator function in the main coding file and reuse it.  code for decorators.py file def print_thricefunc â â â â def wrapper_print_thrice â â â â â â â â func â â â â â â â â func â â â â â â â â func â â â â return wrapper_print_thrice  code for main.py file from decorators import print_thrice print_thrice def say_name â â â â printsimplilearn! say_name as you can see in the output stated above you could import and reuse the print_thrice decorator function to print the output âsimplilearn!â three times. it is possible to chain numerous decorators in python. it is like applying multiple decorators to a single function. all you have to do is to place all the decorators in separate lines before defining the wrapper function. hereâs an example of a chaining decorator in python. def exclamation_decoratorfunction â â â â def wrapperargs kwargs â â â â â â â â print!  25 â â â â â â â â functionargs kwargs â â â â â â â â print!  25 â â â â return wrapper def hashtag_decoratorfunction â â â â def wrapperargs kwargs â â â â â â â â print  25 â â â â â â â â functionargs kwargs â â â â â â â â print  25 â â â â return wrapper exclamation_decorator hashtag_decorator def messagegreet â â â â printgreet messagewelcome to simplilearn if you noticed we used args and kwargs in the previous example. these variables help define generalpurpose decorators in python. they will collect all the positional and keyword arguments that you pass and store them in the args and kwargs variables respectively. these variables allow you to give as many arguments as you want while calling the function thereby making it general. hereâs an example of generalpurpose decorators in python. def general_purpose_decoratorfunction â â â â def a_wrapperargskwargs â â â â â â â â printpositional arguments args â â â â â â â â printkeyword arguments kwargs â â â â â â â â functionargs â â â â return a_wrapper general_purpose_decorator def no_argument â â â â printthere are no arguments. no_argument general_purpose_decorator def positional_argumentsa b c â â â â printthese are positional arguments positional_arguments123 general_purpose_decorator def keyword_arguments â â â â printthese are keyword arguments keyword_argumentscity1_namemumbai city2_namedelhi in the example above you defined a generalpurpose decorator in python. you also passed the positional and keyword arguments separately with different functions. the examples you have seen until now are pretty basic ones to get you acquainted with the concept of decorators. but now since you have a basic understanding letâs look at some advanced decorator functions. stateful decorators are the decorator function that can keep the track of state or in other words remember their previous runâs state. in the code below you have to create a stateful decorator to decorate a dictionary that can store the number of times the function is called. import functools def count_callsfunc â â â â functools.wrapsfunc â â â â def wrapper_count_callsargs kwargs â â â â â â â â wrapper_count_calls.num_calls  1 â â â â â â â â printfcall wrapper_count_calls.num_calls of func.__name__!r â â â â â â â â return funcargs kwargs â â â â wrapper_count_calls.num_calls  0 â â â â return wrapper_count_calls count_calls def say_whee â â â â printwhee! although you can use functions to track the state the typical way is by using a class. similar to the previous example you will create a decorator function to maintain the state of a function. but this time the decorator function will be a class. you will have to call .__inti__ and .__call__ methods to initialize and call the class instance respectively. note that the .__call__ method will be called in this example instead of the decorator function. it will act as the wrapper function that you have been using until now. from functools import update_wrapper class example â â â â def __init__self func â â â â â â â â update_wrapperself func â â â â â â â â self.func  func â â â â â â â â self.example   â â â â â â â â self.n_calls  0 â â â â def __call__self args kwargs â â â â â â â â self.n_calls  1 â â â â â â â â self.exampleself.func.__name__  self.n_calls â â â â â â â â printthe count is  self.example â â â â â â â â return self.funcargs kwargs example def hiname â â â â return fhi name!

      "python decorators are a powerful and elegant feature that allows programmers to modify the behaviour of functions or classes. decorators provide a concise and flexible way to enhance the functionality of existing code without modifying its structure. in this blog post we will explore the concept of decorators in python understand how they work and discover various use cases where decorators can significantly simplify code and promote reusability. python decorators are a way to modify or enhance the behaviour of functions or classes without changing their source code. they allow you to wrap a function or a class with additional functionality by using a special syntax. decorators enable the separation of concerns and code reuse and provide a clean way to add functionality to existing code. to apply a decorator to a function you use the  symbol followed by the decorator name above the function definition. the decorator function is called with the function being decorated as its argument. heres a basic example output in this example decorator_func is the decorator function that wraps the my_function function with additional functionality. heres an additional example with an explanation output in this example we have a decorator called uppercase_decorator. it takes the greet function as an argument and returns a new function wrapper_func. the wrapper_func calls the original function and converts its return value to uppercase before returning it. when we decorate the greet function with uppercase_decorator it is equivalent to writing greet  uppercase_decoratorgreet. this means that whenever we call the greet function it will first go through the uppercase_decorator which transforms the result to uppercase. in the print greetjohn statement we pass the name john to the decorated greet function. the decorator modifies the return value of the greet function making it all uppercase. as a result the output is hello john!. this example demonstrates how a decorator can modify the behaviour of a function by wrapping it with additional functionality. in this case the decorator converts the greeting message to uppercase providing consistent formatting across different greetings without modifying the original greet function. in python decorators can be implemented using either functions or classes. decorator functions are simpler and more commonly used. they are defined as regular functions that accept the function to be decorated as an argument and return a new function that incorporates the additional functionality. decorator classes on the other hand are defined as classes that implement the __call__ method. the __call__ method is called when the decorated function is called allowing you to add functionality before and after the function execution. while decorator functions are more straightforward and widely used decorator classes offer more flexibility and can maintain state across multiple function calls. decorators can be applied to various scenarios to enhance the behaviour of functions or classes. here are some common use cases decorators can be used to log function calls measure execution time or add timestamps. this can be particularly useful for debugging or performance optimisation purposes. heres an example that showcases how a decorator can be used for logging and timing output in this example we have a decorator called log_and_time that adds logging and timing functionality to the decorated function. the log_and_time decorator defines a wrapper function wrapper which measures the execution time of the decorated function and prints the relevant information. it uses the time.time function to calculate the start and end times and then calculate the elapsed time. by using the functools.wraps decorator we ensure that the wrapper function retains the original functions name and docstring preserving metadata and improving code clarity. the process_data function is decorated with log_and_time meaning that every time process_data is called it will first go through the log_and_time decorator. in the example we simulate data processing with time.sleep2 statement. after calling process_data with the data list the decorator logs the function call measures the execution time and displays the result. the output shows the function name execution time and the returned result. by using decorators for logging and timing you can easily add this functionality to multiple functions without duplicating code. it helps with performance analysis debugging and understanding the execution time of different functions in your codebase. decorators can validate the input parameters of a function ensuring that they meet certain criteria or constraints. this helps in enforcing data integrity and preventing errors. heres an example that demonstrates how a decorator can be used for input validation output in this example we define a decorator called validate_input that performs input validation before executing the decorated function. the validate_input decorator defines a wrapper function wrapper which iterates over the arguments and keyword arguments passed to the decorated function. it checks if the arguments are integers and if the keyword arguments are strings. if any validation condition fails it raises a typeerror with an appropriate message. the calculate_sum function is decorated with validate_input which means that when it is called the arguments and keyword arguments will be validated validate_input decorator. in the example we first call calculate_sum with valid inputs of 2 and 3. the decorator allows the execution and the result is printed as the sum is 5. however when we call calculate_sum with a string 2 instead of an integer the decorator detects the invalid input type and raises a typeerror with the appropriate error message. by using decorators for input validation you can ensure that the inputs of your functions meet certain criteria or constraints improving the reliability and integrity of your code. decorators can cache the return values of a function based on its input parameters. this can significantly improve performance by avoiding redundant computations or expensive operations. heres an example that illustrates how a decorator can be used for caching output in this example we define a decorator called cache_results that provides caching functionality for the decorated function. the cache_results decorator uses a dictionary cache to store the results of function calls. the dictionarys keys are tuples consisting of the arguments args and a frozen set of keyword arguments kwargs. this ensures that the cache is hashable since tuples and frozen sets are immutable. the wrapper function within the decorator checks if the function has been called with the same arguments before. if the result is present in the cache it is returned. otherwise the function is executed and the result is stored in the cache before being returned. the functools.wraps decorator is used to preserve the original functions metadata such as its name and docstring. in the example we apply the cache_results decorator to the fibonacci function. the fibonacci function uses recursion to calculate the fibonacci sequence. when the function is called the decorator checks if the result for a specific argument set is present in the cache. if it is the cached result is returned. otherwise the function is executed and the result is cached for future use. the output demonstrates the caching behaviour. when we call fibonacci 5 and fibonacci 4 the results are calculated and stored in the cache. however when we call fibonacci 5 again the cached result is retrieved avoiding redundant calculations. by using decorators for caching you can significantly improve the performance of functions that have expensive computations or repetitive operations. caching the results allows you to avoid redundant calculations and retrieve the results directly from the cache when the same inputs are encountered again. decorators can be used to enforce authentication and authorization checks before executing certain functions. they can ensure that only authorized users have access to specific functionality. memoization is a technique where the return values of a function are cached for a given set of input parameters. decorators can be used to implement memoization and optimize function execution by reusing previous results. python allows you to create custom decorators to suit your specific needs. here are two techniques for creating custom decorators you can create decorators that accept additional arguments by introducing an extra layer of nested functions. the outer function takes the arguments and returns the actual decorator function which then wraps the decorated function. heres an example that demonstrates how decorators can accept arguments output in this example we define a decorator called repeat that accepts an argument n. the repeat decorator returns another decorator who takes the function to be decorated. the inner decorator defines a wrapper function which wraps the original function. within the wrapper function the decorated function is called n a number of times using a loop. by using the functools.wraps decorator we ensure that the wrapper function retains the original functions name and docstring. in the example we apply the repeat3 decorator to the greet function which means that the greet function will be called three times when invoked. when we call greetjohn the decorated greet function is executed three times resulting in the greeting message hello john! being printed three times. using decorators with arguments allows you to customize the behaviour of the decorator based on the provided arguments. it provides flexibility and enables you to create reusable decorators that can be parameterized for different use cases. decorators can be chained together to combine their effects. this allows you to apply multiple decorators to a single function providing a different aspect of functionality. heres an example that demonstrates how decorators can be chained output in this example we define two decorators make_bold and make_italic. each decorator modifies the output of the decorated function by wrapping it with additional formatting. the make_bold decorator adds b tags around the result making it bold while the make_italic decorator adds i tags making it italicized. the decorators are applied to the greet function using the  syntax. note that the order of the decorators matters. in this case the make_italic decorator is applied first followed by the make_bold decorator. when we call greetjohn the decorators are chained meaning that the output of the greet function is passed through the make_italic decorator first and then the result is passed through the make_bold decorator. the final output is a formatted string with both bold and italic tags bihello john!ib. chaining decorators allows you to combine multiple decorators to achieve the desired behaviour for your functions. by applying decorators in a specific order you can create a sequence of transformations on the output of the decorated function. in addition to decorating individual functions decorators can also be applied to classes. this opens up new possibilities for enhancing the behaviour and functionality of classes. there are two ways to decorate classes class decorators are applied to the entire class and modify its behaviour as a whole. they can add or modify class attributes and methods or even replace the class entirely. heres an example that demonstrates how class decorators can be used in this example we define a class decorator called add_method. the add_method decorator takes a class as an argument and adds a new method called add to it. inside the decorator we define a new_method function that takes self x and y as parameters and performs the addition operation. we then assign this new_method to the add attribute of the class. the decorator returns the modified class allowing it to be used as a class decorator. in the example we apply the add_method decorator to the calculator class. this adds the add method to the calculator class dynamically. we create an instance of the calculator class called calc. we can then call the add method on this instance passing 2 and 3 as arguments. the method performs the addition operation and returns the result which is 5. class decorators provide a way to modify the behaviour of a class or add new functionality to it. they allow you to extend classes dynamically by adding methods and attributes or altering their behaviour at runtime. method decorators are applied to specific methods within a class and provide additional functionality to those methods. they can modify method behaviour validate inputs or execute code before and after method execution. heres an example that demonstrates how method decorators can be used output hello world! in this example we define a method decorator called uppercase_decorator. the uppercase_decorator takes a method as an argument and returns a new method that converts the result to uppercase. inside the decorator we define a wrapper function that takes self the instance of the class and text as parameters. the wrapper function invokes the original method and stores its result in the result variable. then it converts the result to uppercase before returning it. the decorator returns the modified wrapper method allowing it to be used as a method decorator. in the example we apply the uppercase_decorator decorator to the process_text method of the textprocessor class. this decorates the method adding the uppercase transformation to its return value. we create an instance of the textprocessor class called processor. we then call the process_text method on this instance passing the string hello world! as an argument. the method performs some processing in this case it simply returns the text and the decorator converts the result to uppercase. the final output is the uppercase version of the processed text hello world!. method decorators allow you to modify the behaviour of specific methods within a class. they provide a way to add functionality or alter the return values of methods without modifying the original implementation of the class. decorators are widely used in various python libraries and frameworks to simplify common tasks and promote code reuse. here are a couple of examples flask a popular web framework utilizes decorators extensively. decorators in flask are used to define routes and bind them to functions that handle http requests. for example the app.route decorator in flask allows you to define different routes and associate them with specific functions making it easy to build apis or web applications. in this example the app.route decorator maps the url paths  and about to the index of the respective function and about. when a user accesses these paths flask automatically calls the corresponding functions and returns the result. django another popular web framework uses decorators for various purposes. one notable example is the login_required decorator which ensures that only authenticated users can access certain views or pages. by applying this decorator to a view function django checks if the user is logged in before allowing access. in this example the login_required decorator ensures that the restricted_area function can only be accessed by authenticated users. if an unauthenticated user tries to access the page they will be redirected to the login page. related read django vs flask what is the difference between django  flask? decorators in python are a powerful tool for enhancing the behaviour and functionality of functions and classes. they provide a clean and flexible way to add functionality without modifying the original code. by leveraging decorators you can separate concerns improve code reuse and make your code more concise and readable. in this blog post we explored the concept of decorators their syntax and basic usage. we compared decorator functions and decorator classes highlighting their differences and use cases. we also discussed common scenarios where decorators can be beneficial such as logging input validation caching authentication and memoization. furthermore we explored creating custom decorators with arguments and chaining decorators to combine their effects. we also explored how decorators can be applied to classes both at the class level and to individual methods. lastly we examined the usage of decorators in popular python libraries like flask and django showcasing their realworld applications. by understanding and utilizing the power of decorators you can take your python programming skills to the next level making your code more elegant modular and reusable. so embrace decorators and unlock their potential to transform your python code. rajat is a backend developer
